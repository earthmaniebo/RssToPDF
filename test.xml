        <description><![CDATA[SYDNEY --- A man who taxied his light plane down a street in Australia and parked it at a pub while he went inside for a beer was being questioned Monday by police, who were not amused.

&nbsp;

Locals in Newman, Western Australia, were stunned when they saw the wingless Beechcraft two-seater aircraft chugging down the main drag of the mining town in the Pilbara region, before pulling up at the local watering hole.

&nbsp;

"On the way back through town... here's a plane parked outside the Purple Pub," Newman resident Beau Woolcock told ABC radio.

MANILA, Philippines -- Vice President Jejomar Binay is free to leave the Cabinet if he thinks the administration is on a wrong path, President Benigno Aquino III said on Monday.

&nbsp;

Aquino, in a televised ambush interview with media, said Binay should present solutions instead of just criticizing his administration.

&nbsp;

"If he thinks we have shortcomings, he is a member of the Cabinet so he should tell us. If not, tell us how to improve the system. And that is not a choice for him to make but an obligation as a member of the Cabinet," he said.

The South's National Intelligence Service (NIS) said in a report to parliament last week that North Korea attempted to hack more than 20,000 South Korean smartphones from May to September.

NEW YORK -- Hotels don't want guests to have to linger at the front desk --- or even stop by at all.

&nbsp;

New programs are helping speed up the check-in process for busy travelers, or in at least one case, letting them go straight to their rooms by using their smartphone to unlock doors.

&nbsp;

The innovations are still being tweaked as hotels scramble to catch up to airlines. Fliers today use their phones to check in, select seats and as a boarding pass. Hotels envision a similar relationship, with guests ultimately ordering poolside drinks via an app.

MANILA, Philippines --- For every smart gadget, computer, flat-screen monitor, and television set, there's a semiconductor that is essential to run these sophisticated electronic devices.

Because semiconductors are found inside the body of today's most advanced devices (read: not visible), it's easy to forget how essential they are to their performance. Unbeknownst to many, semiconductors serve as a conduit at its most basic form, a very small switchboard that allows the flow of electricity.

Such highly sophisticated and specialized production of these chips requires expertise that is hard to come by. This is where Phoenix Semiconductor Philippines Corp. (PSPC) comes in.

Jennifer's husband, Richard, was among the more than 7,350 people who perished when Super Typhoon "Yolanda" (international name: Haiyan), one of the strongest storms on record, razed dozens of farming and fishing communities in the central Philippines.

&nbsp;

Basbao revealed that they were about to embark on the third round of talks to make the two camps agree.

PARIS -- It's been quite a year for Novak Djokovic, who is driving towards another year-ending number one spot, recently becoming a proud father and winning his third Paris Masters crown for his 600th ATP victory.

&nbsp;

The popular 27-year-old Serb said at the beginning of last week that becoming a dad had already made him feel like number one, but he is also doing his talking on the court, breezing through an elite field in the French capital without dropping a set.

&nbsp;

His 6-2, 6-3 victory over big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic on Sunday emphasized his dominance in world tennis, but there is still one tournament to go at the season-ending World Tour Finals...<br/><br/>Keep on reading: <a href="http://sports.inquirer.net/167209/djokovic-on-top-of-the-world-after-paris-win-and-fatherhood">Djokovic on top of the world after Paris win and fatherhood</a>]]></description>

MOJAVE, California -- The loss of an experimental spaceship that broke up over the Mojave Desert, killing one pilot and seriously injuring another, has renewed criticism of the way the craft's designer and Virgin Galactic handled a deadly explosion seven years ago.

&nbsp;

Space enthusiasts watching Virgin Galactic's race to send tourists on suborbital flights have complained for years about a 2007 explosion that killed three people on the ground and critically injured three others during a ground test in the development of a rocket engine for the same vehicle that crashed Friday.
